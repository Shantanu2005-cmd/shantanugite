     <p>A motorcycle (motorbike, bike, or, if three-wheeled, a trike) is a two or three-wheeled motor vehicle steered by a handlebar from 
        a saddle-style seat.Motorcycle designs vary greatly to suit a range of different purposes: long-distance travel, commuting,
         cruising, sport (including racing), and off-road riding. Motorcycling is riding a motorcycle and being involved in other
          related social activities such as joining a motorcycle club and attending motorcycle rallies.
        The 1885 Daimler Reitwagen made by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Germany was the first internal combustion, 
        petroleum-fueled motorcycle. In 1894, Hildebrand & Wolfmüller became the first series production motorcycle.[4][5]
         Globally, motorcycles are comparable numerically to cars as a method of transport: in 2021, approximately 58.6 million 
         new motorcycles were sold around the world,[6] while 66.7 million cars were sold over the same period.[7]</p>

     <p>A car, or an automobile, is a motor vehicle with wheels. Most definitions of cars state that they run primarily on roads, seat one 
        to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people over cargo.[1][2] There are around one billion cars in use worldwide.
 The French inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769, while the Swiss inventor François Isaac
  de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal combustion-powered automobile in 1808. The modern car—a practical, marketable 
  automobile for everyday use—was invented in 1886, when the German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Commercial
   cars became widely available during the 20th century. The 1901 Oldsmobile Curved Dash and the 1908 Ford Model T, both American cars, 
   are widely considered the first mass-produced[3][4] and mass-affordable[5][6][7] cars, respectively. Cars were rapidly adopted in the
    US, where they replaced horse-drawn carriages.[8] In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase
     until after World War II.[9] In the 21st century, car usage is still increasing rapidly, especially in China, India, and other newly 
     industrialised countries</p>

     <p>ChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot[2][3] developed by OpenAI and launched in 2022. It is based on the
         GPT-4o large language model (LLM). ChatGPT can generate human-like conversational responses, and enables users to refine and
          steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language.[4] It is credited with accelerating
           the AI boom, which has led to ongoing rapid investment in and public attention to the field of artificial intelligence.[5]
            Some observers have raised concern about the potential of ChatGPT and similar programs to displace human intelligence, 
            enable plagiarism, or fuel misinformation.</p>

    <p>India, officially the Republic of India,[j][20] is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country in the world by area 
        and the most populous country. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal
         on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[k] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and 
         Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands
          share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia.</p>

     <p>Formula One, commonly known as Formula 1 or F1, is the highest class of international racing for open-wheel single-seater 
        formula racing cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The FIA Formula One World Championship 
        has been one of the world's premier forms of motorsport since its inaugural running in 1950. The word formula in the name refers
         to the set of rules all participants' cars must follow. A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix. 
         Grands Prix take place in multiple countries and continents on either purpose-built circuits or closed roads.</p>
